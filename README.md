# NepaliLyricsClustering

Music is an art and a form of expression that involves Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, instruments and so on. The type of music or what we call a music genre is generally determined by different characteristics such as instruments, rhythms, cultural context or a geographical category. Lyrics maybe used as an identifier of a genre but one can argue that same lyrics can be sung in two different genre while expressing the same thing through language. 

In this project, titled Nepali Lyrics Clustering, I aim to group various Nepali artists based solely on the words they use in their songs. By analyzing the lyrical content, we can explore how closely related or distinct these artists are from one another. This approach not only highlights the richness of Nepali music but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the linguistic and thematic diversity within the genre.Given the unique characteristics of the Nepali language, this analysis is approached as a natural language processing (NLP) task. By leveraging NLP techniques, we can uncover patterns and relationships within the lyrics that may not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis.
